<h2>The project</h2>
<p>This is a simple website made in SvelteKit - A JavaScript framework. It tells the visitors a bit about the bot and has a list of all It's commands. I started this project to learn Svelte and to have something cool to show off about the bot. The bot was not originally owned by me but instead one of my friends @TheEpicDragons aka FiFi.</p>

<h2>The UI</h2>
<p>You may have already noticed that this website has a distinct Windows 11 like UI deisgn. That is intentional and was made possible with fluent-svelte which calles itself as "A faithful implementation of Microsoft's Fluent Design System in Svelte". You should check it out over <a href="https://fluent-svelte.vercel.app/">here</a></p>

<h2>The story behind it</h2>
<p>Well, the creation of this website also had a short story. So the bot's commands and their descriptions were originally listed on gitbook. I myself and other people were not satisfied with the less amount of customization it gave. So, I decided to make a website for the same. This project had started almost 2 months ago and took me about 1 - 1.5 months to learn the basics of svelte and what all I was doing wrong - Let me tell you, I was doing a lot wrong. At the end I just decided to use a UI liberary.</p>
